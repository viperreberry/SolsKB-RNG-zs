local lootTable = {
    "Common Item",
    "Rare Item",
    "Epic Item",
    "Legendary Item"
}

local rng = SolRNG.new()
local lootChance = rng:GetRandomNumber(1, 100)

if lootChance <= 60 then
    print("You got a " .. lootTable[1])  -- Common Item
elseif lootChance <= 85 then
    print("You got a " .. lootTable[2])  -- Rare Item
elseif lootChance <= 95 then
    print("You got a " .. lootTable[3])  -- Epic Item
else
    print("You got a " .. lootTable[4])  -- Legendary Item
